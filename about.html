                        I am 32 years old bachelor of business from Oulu, Finland. I worked in a bank for 5 years before
                        I
                        decided it was time for something new. I had always been interested in computers and
                        programming, so
                        I
                        decided to study information technology in Oulu University of Applied Sciences. I am currently
                        in my
                        second year of studies. I have been studying programming languages such as Java, C#, C++,
                        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, Kotlin
                        and
                        SQL. I am interested in all kinds of programming and eager
                        to
                        learn new things.
                        I am a team player and I have good communication skills. I get along pretty much with everyone
                        and even if I dont agree with every viewpoint, I still appreciate and really try to understand
                        and learn from them.

                        Currently I am looking at internship opportunities for the summer of 2024 and if possible even
                        continue to work part-time for the compnay after that during the school year.
