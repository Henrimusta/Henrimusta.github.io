            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <h2>Bank simulation project</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a group project made mainly using C++. In this project we used local back end made with
                mySQL. I was responsible for logging in and authentication of user throughout various components also
                graphic design of the UI was mainly made by me. Also lot of other areas in this code was co-coded with
                other participants This project was the first real software project and it was a great learning
                experience. After this project was done I was certain that software development really is what I want to
                continue to do and learn more about.

                        project</a>
                </li>
            </p>
            <h2>Webpage</h2>
            <p>
                This project which actually is this portfolio/webpage was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This was
                a first time creating a webpage and I learned alot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also learned how to
                use GitHub better and how to deploy a webpage to GitHub pages. The original project had elements like
                quiz and a weather app but as I turned this page towards a regular protfolio resulting in removing
                unnecessary parts of the page. This was a fun project and main thing that I got from this is that there
                is always something that could be done better and as a developer I feel like this is never finished.
            </p>
            <h2>Movie database project</h2>
            <p>
                This project was React.js web development project. In this project we used online database in Render
                with node and PostgreSQL. I was responsible for creating the foundation of the application, which now
                serves as the Home page. At the same time, I established a consistent style template for the entire
                website. For navigation, I created an element called Navbar. I was also builded the Reviews page and its
                features related to movie reviews, excluding changing the order. I created the ReviewForm component and
                saving user reviews to the database. These main components also have subcomponents that I created to
                enhance the functionality of the site, such as the MovieCard component. I also participated in the
                development of the Group and Profiles pages. I really enjoyed this project and using React.js so much
                that I actually ended up propably doing too long days resulting in worse performance during the next
                day. I learned alot of new things and I am really looking forward to learning more about React.js. I
                also learned that time management is esssential in software development.
